# Stock-Analysis
Performing analysis on Stock data to determine the returns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background

An Excel workbook was created for Steven, with a click of a button, to analyze an entire dataset. However, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years (2017 & 2018). The original Microsft Excel VBA code works well for a dozen stocks, but may take a long time to execute for thousands of stocks. In the new Excel workbook, we refactored the code to loop through all the data in order to collect the same information. Refactoring a code can make the code more efficient, take fewer steps, use less memory, or improve logic of code to make it easier for future users to read. 

The orignal data presented include two charts (2017 & 2018) with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains: 1) Ticker (e.g. DQ), 2) Date, 3) Opening, 4) High Price, 5) Low Price, 6) Closing, 7) Adjusted Closing, and 8) Volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the Ticker, the Total Daily Volume, and the Return on each stock.

## Results

### Analysis of stock performance between 2017 and 2018
